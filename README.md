## Description :label:

For the project "real-time-web" we had to make an application that works with web-sockets. So we can make a "watcher" to the server and watch data in real time. The reason why we want to use web-sockets instead of Polling is because we want to show data when it changed so we don't make unecessery request to the server.

## Activity Diagram

Here you see the most common-flow in the app and how the service-worker finds his place init.

## Socketio

## Usage

For using this app yourself you need to follow the following steps:

### 1. Clone Repo locally

```
git clone https://github.com/TristanVarewijck/TechDefined.git
```

### 2. Connect your API key

If you want to connect with the API you have to fill in your own personal {apiKey} wich you can get here: <br>
[Get NewsAPI apiKey](https://newsapi.org/).

```
https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=${input.value}&sortBy=publishedAt&language=en&pageSize=100&apiKey=${apiKey}
https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&category=technology&pageSize=100&apiKey=${apiKey}
```

### 3. Install dependencies

Install to need dependencies for using this project.

```
npm i
```

### 4. Run on Localhost

Because i am using the free version of this API your need to run it on your localhost to test it. If you want to move further with this app make sure to check out the [pricing scheme](https://newsapi.org/pricing) of NewsAPI.

For easily running this project on your localhost you can use the command:

```
npm start
```

### Thats it! :smile:


## Grading
Your efforts will be graded using a single point rubric (see below). You will have to pass the criterion (centre column) to pass the course. During the test you will be consulted and will be given feedback on things we think deficient and things we think are an improvement on the criterion.

| Deficiency | Criterion | Improvement |
|:--|:--|:--|
|  | *Project* Your app is working and published on Heroku. Your project is thoroughly documented in the `README.md` file in your repository. Included are a description of the data-lifecycle, real-time events and external data source used by your app. |  |
|  | *Complexity* You’ve implemented enough real-time functionality for us to test your comprehension of the subject. A lot of functionality is self-written. You are able to manipulate online examples live. |  |
|  | *Client-server interaction* By interacting with the app, a user can influence the data model of the server in real time by directly modifying data OR by influencing API requests between server and source. The student has set up the data manipulations. |  |
|  | *Data management* The server maintains a data model and each client is continuously updated with the correct data. |  |
|  | *Multi-user support* Multiple clients can connect to the server. Interaction works as expected and is not dependent on the number of clients. You can explain how your app approaches this. |  |






<!-- Here are some hints for your project! -->

<!-- Start out with a title and a description -->

<!-- Add a nice image here at the end of the week, showing off your shiny frontend 📸 -->

<!-- Add a link to your live demo in Github Pages 🌐-->

<!-- replace the code in the /docs folder with your own, so you can showcase your work with GitHub Pages 🌍 -->

<!-- Maybe a table of contents here? 📚 -->

<!-- ☝️ replace this description with a description of your own work -->

<!-- How about a section that describes how to install this project? 🤓 -->

<!-- ...but how does one use this project? What are its features 🤔 -->

<!-- What external data source is featured in your project and what are its properties 🌠 -->

<!-- This would be a good place for your data life cycle ♻️-->

<!-- Maybe a checklist of done stuff and stuff still on your wishlist? ✅ -->

<!-- We all stand on the shoulders of giants, please link all the sources you used in to create this project. -->

<!-- How about a license here? When in doubt use GNU GPL v3. 📜  -->
